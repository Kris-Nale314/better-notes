    ## How It Works
    
    Better Notes uses a lean architecture with these key components:
    
    1. **Smart Chunking**: Divides documents into meaningful sections
    2. **Multi-level Processing**: Analyzes text at different granularities
    3. **Hierarchical Synthesis**: Combines information into a coherent whole
    
    The application is built with a modular design that allows for easy extension
    with new capabilities through the "passes" system.
    
    ## Technologies
    
    - **Backend**: Python with AsyncIO for efficient processing
    - **Frontend**: Streamlit for a simple, interactive user interface
    - **AI**: OpenAI's GPT models for text analysis and generation
    
    ## Getting Started
    
    1. Navigate to the Summarization page using the sidebar
    2. Upload a document or paste text
    3. Adjust processing options as needed
    4. Generate your enhanced notes

    You are an expert at identifying action items. Your task is to analyze the following document section and extract any tasks, commitments, follow-up items, or assignments.

    Document Section:
    {chunk_text}

    Position in document: {chunk_position}

    User Instructions: {options.user_instructions if options.user_instructions else 'Extract all action items, including their owners and deadlines where mentioned.'}

    For each action item you identify, please provide:
    1. The specific task or action to be performed
    2. The owner or person responsible for the task (if mentioned)
    3. Any deadline or timeframe (if mentioned)
    4. A brief description or context for the action

    Look for:
    - Explicit assignments: "John will prepare the report"
    - Commitments: "I'll take care of that"
    - Tasks with deadlines: "Complete the review by Friday"
    - Follow-up items: "We need to circle back on this"
    - Decisions requiring action: "We decided to update the policy"

    Be thorough but focus on clear action items rather than vague statements.

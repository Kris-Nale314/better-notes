    You are an expert analyst specializing in issue identification. Your task is to carefully analyze the following document to identify any issues, problems, challenges, or concerns.

    Document Summary:
    {summary}

    Document Information:
    - Document Type: {document_info.get('is_meeting_transcript', False) and 'Meeting Transcript' or 'Document'}
    - Topics: {', '.join(document_info.get('preview_analysis', {}).get('key_topics', [])) if document_info.get('preview_analysis') and isinstance(document_info.get('preview_analysis'), dict) else 'Various topics'}

    User Instructions: {options.user_instructions if options.user_instructions else 'Identify all significant issues.'}

    For each issue you identify, please provide:
    1. A clear, concise title
    2. A detailed description of the issue
    3. The severity level (critical, high, medium, or low)
    4. Who mentioned or is associated with the issue (if identifiable)
    5. Relevant context or direct quotes from the document

    CRITICAL issues are those that:
    - Represent immediate threats to operations, security, or compliance
    - Could cause significant financial loss or reputational damage
    - Are blocking major processes or deliverables

    HIGH severity issues are those that:
    - Significantly impact effectiveness or efficiency
    - Require substantial resources to address
    - Will likely escalate if not addressed soon

    MEDIUM severity issues are those that:
    - Cause ongoing inefficiency or limitations
    - Negatively impact some stakeholders
    - Should be addressed, but aren't urgent

    LOW severity issues are those that:
    - Represent minor inconveniences or concerns
    - Have minimal impact on operations or outcomes
    - Could be addressed through regular maintenance or improvements

    Focus on the most significant issues first. Provide specific context when possible.

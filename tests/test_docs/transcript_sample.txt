Meeting Transcript: Product Development Team
Date: January 15, 2023
Participants: John Smith, Lisa Wong, Michael Johnson, Sarah Lee

10:00 AM - Meeting Start

John: Good morning everyone. Today we'll be discussing the roadmap for Q2 and addressing some of the issues that came up in our user testing last week.

Lisa: Before we start, I wanted to mention that we got some new feedback from the beta testers. Their main concern is still the loading time for large files.

Michael: I think we need to prioritize that. The current solution isn't scaling well with files over 100MB.

John: I agree. Let's put that at the top of our list.

Sarah: I've been working on an optimization that might help. I can share the preliminary results after this meeting.

10:15 AM - Q2 Roadmap Discussion

John: Let's move on to the Q2 roadmap. The main features we planned were the collaborative editing, export to multiple formats, and the new dashboard design.

Lisa: The design team has completed most of the mockups for the dashboard. I can share those with everyone after the meeting.

Michael: For the collaborative editing feature, we need to decide if we're going with the WebSocket approach or the conflict resolution model.

Sarah: I think the WebSocket approach would be better for real-time collaboration, but it might be more complex to implement.

John: Let's weigh the pros and cons. What's the development timeline difference between the two approaches?

Michael: The WebSocket approach might take an extra 2-3 weeks, but would provide a better user experience.

10:30 AM - Technical Discussion

Sarah: I've been researching some optimization techniques for large file handling. We could implement a streaming parser instead of loading the entire file into memory.

Michael: That's a good idea. We'd need to refactor the file handler class, but it should be doable within our timeline.

Lisa: Would this affect the existing features that rely on the current file handler?

Sarah: We would need to update some dependencies, but I've mapped most of them out already.

John: How confident are we that this will solve the performance issues?

Sarah: Based on my tests with similar implementations, we could see a 70-80% improvement in loading times for large files.

10:45 AM - Action Items

John: Let's summarize the action items. Sarah will continue working on the file optimization and share results by Friday.

Michael: I'll prepare a detailed comparison of the WebSocket vs. conflict resolution approaches by next Monday.

Lisa: I'll share the dashboard designs with everyone today and collect feedback by the end of the week.

John: And I'll update the roadmap to prioritize the file performance improvements. Does anyone have anything else to add?

Sarah: I'll need some help testing the optimization with different file types.

John: Michael, can you help Sarah with that?

Michael: Yes, I can allocate some time on Thursday.

11:00 AM - Meeting Adjourned

John: Thanks everyone. Let's meet again next week to review progress.

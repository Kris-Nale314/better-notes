**1. Lack of specific financial figures:**

The issue of lacking specific financial figures such as profit margins, expenses, and net income in the document on Dell Technologies Inc.'s Q4 FY2025 financial results can significantly impact stakeholders' ability to fully assess the company's financial performance. Without detailed financial data, investors, analysts, and other stakeholders may face challenges in understanding the underlying factors driving revenue growth and the overall profitability of Dell. This limitation could lead to uncertainties in decision-making processes and hinder the evaluation of Dell's financial health.

**Recommendation:** To address this issue, it is recommended that Dell Technologies Inc. provides a breakdown of key financial metrics including profit margins, expenses, net income, and any relevant financial ratios in future reports to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive view of the company's financial performance.

**2. Limited mention of challenges or risks:**

The limited mention of challenges, risks, or areas of improvement in the document focusing on positive aspects like revenue growth and profitability for the ISG segment could present a skewed view of Dell's performance in Q4 FY2025. By not addressing potential obstacles or risks faced by the company, stakeholders might not have a complete picture of the factors that could impact Dell's future financial results and strategic direction. Including a discussion on challenges and risks would provide a more balanced and transparent assessment of Dell's performance.

**Recommendation:** Dell should incorporate a section in its financial reports that specifically addresses challenges, risks, and areas of improvement encountered during the reporting period to provide stakeholders with a more holistic perspective on the company's performance and future outlook.

**3. Lack of competitor analysis:**

The absence of competitor analysis in the report limits stakeholders' ability to benchmark Dell Technologies Inc.'s performance against industry peers. Understanding how Dell compares to its competitors in terms of market share, product offerings, and financial performance is crucial for investors and analysts to assess the company's competitive position and strategic advantages.

**Recommendation:** Dell should include a dedicated section in its financial reports that analyzes key competitors, their strengths and weaknesses, market positioning, and any competitive threats they pose. This analysis will help stakeholders evaluate Dell's competitive landscape and strategic positioning more effectively.
